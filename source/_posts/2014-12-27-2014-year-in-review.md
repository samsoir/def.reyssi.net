This past year has been quite a substantial one for me, both personally and professionally. Entering the year in January I had recently taken responsibility for Technology at Sittercity. Sittercity had just finished constructing a new platform, which brought excitement and headaches in equal measure. And I was in the third and final year of my current US Visa. The road already looked long as January began.

Twelve months later as December draws to its close I am astonished at all the changes, growth and pain that was endured through this year. Now we approach 2015, or “the future” as Marty McFly exclaimed in Back to the Future Part 2, and I want to briefly review much of what has past this year.

## A New Hope

For eighteen long months through 2012 and well into 2013 Sittercity was busy building a new platform to continue growing the business. The new platform was a major change from the former PHP powered application that preceded. Codenamed “Empire”, the new platform would introduce a new look and feel to the Sittercity site, refined product offerings and new partnerships. Empire went to production in November 2013 and the remaining part of the year was focused on stabilizing the new system.

This was not surprising to anyone, least myself, as any brand new platform built for established businesses always seem to have a difficult birth. I had experienced this phenomena previously and you just have to get through a necessary period of maintenance. After almost two months of relentless fixes, Sittercity was beginning to thrive. As January started, the company began to witness the some of the effort in numbers, as record numbers of Sitters began registering.

Entering the year I was busy setting the technology agenda for the year, along with a large budget. There were many things I wanted to change in 2014. However, the ongoing maintenance of Empire meant that none of what I wanted to do would be done in January.

However a new business objective for Sittercity was emerging and one this one would be a challenge to meet. As much as everyone was enjoying the new Sittercity web site there was an increasing demand for a native mobile experience. Unfortunately the new platform had not considered this requirement. There was no API available for mobile applications to communicate with. Additionally the current infrastructure did not provide granular  scalability to support controlled capacity management for large numbers of devices pulling data.

Much of January was spent with the senior team devising our strategy to meet the deadline and deliver on both a new infrastructure platform and a new Public API. The net result was three discreet projects to address the new infrastructure requirement, the new Public API and of course the iOS and Android native applications.

Infrastructure 2 would be a completely new application stack, built around [Linux Containers](https://linuxcontainers.org) (LXC) technology. As I write this, much of the technology world is getting excited by LXC in the form or [Docker](https://www.docker.com) and [CoreOS](https://coreos.com), both of which have received a lot of attention this year. It is hard to imagine now but twelve months ago Docker was still in its infancy, although maturing quickly; and CoreOS was off my radar completely. Due to these factors, we decided to develop our own internal frameworks around LXC, using [Apache Zookeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org) as the backbone of our hypervisor for Infrastructure 2.

Given the development speed of Docker at the time, we decided to ensure that we built Infrastructure 2 in such a way that if we decided to migrate to Docker or CoreOS in future, it would be possible with minimal effort. This still remains true today, even though there is no intention of moving any time soon. This also meant that much of the tooling we are developing is un-opinionated, thus we will be looking to open source components of Infrastructure 2 in 2015.

The Public API would be built as an independent application to our main Sittercity applications. Empire had been built in a monolithic paradigm. The new world would be built as a collection of micro-services. This would mean that the Public API could use whatever delivery mechanisms it liked, and importantly not use Rails. It also established a clear boundary between the Public API and Sittercity, which had other clear architectural benefits, most of which would pay dividends later in the year.

Finally a new team were tasked to develop and build the consumer native application that would sit upon the Public API and Infrastructure 2.

As January drew to a close I had a clear plan for how the year, at least the first six months would progress. The budget was locked in and three teams needed to be briefed. All of this while we had to maintain business as usual for the regular Sittercity web site, which meant continual releases multiple times a day in some cases all the way through February.

## Polar Vortex hits Chicago, Mono hits me

February came in with some force, on the back of a massive Polar Vortex that descended on Chicago at the tail end of January and persisted into the following month.

Unfortunately February for me was mostly spent horizontal at home as I contracted a horrible virus in the form of _Glandular Fever_ as I knew it from the UK. Of course the doctors here provided me with a diagnosis of _Infectious Mononucleosis_, or “Mono” as they use colloquially in these parts. After a bit of Googling I realized I was in for a rough ride. Somehow I had managed to avoid contracting this virus at University and thus like many others out there was completely open to infection when it came. The origin of this infection is still a mystery, although doctors did warn me that I would carry it for the rest of my life and it would “activate” again at certain times – terrifying! This activation would be totally benign to me, but potentially bad to anyone else who has not had the virus.

Before everyone begins giving me a wide birth for fear of future infection, do not worry. The virus is transmitted primarily through saliva exchanges, usually in the form of kissing or other equally fun sexual activities. This is why _Mono_ is also referred to as the “kissing disease”. However, kissing is not the exclusive transmission method. If you have not had this virus then just be prepared for the eventual day it will come knocking. Alternatively to ensure complete protection, you can lock yourself in a vacuum and never have contact with anything ever again. The choice is yours!

Thankfully, my significant other had already had _Mono_ during her youth and was immune to this virus, so she was safe to help me through the worst. It must be mentioned that without her support it would have been so much more difficult to endure.

At the end of February I was several pounds lighter and lacking energy to stay awake past seven in the evening. But I was free of the worst of the virus and returned to regular work.

February ended and March started with a trip to Montana. After being ill for so long, I was not sure going snowboarding was necessarily the best idea. However, the call of the mountain was too irresistible for me to ignore and so off to Big Sky I went with my snowboards and some friends.

As it turned out the trip was incredibly useful. After a rocky start to the year, getting out into the clean air and exercising daily provided a real boost to my mental health. I made a couple of difficult decisions whilst traversing the mountain and was ready to get back to real work at the end of the week. Once again this reminded me that getting good rest and relaxation is vital for a healthy work life.

## Best laid schemes o’ mice an’ men

Returning to work was novel for a couple of days, then realities began setting in. The plan that I had devised with the team for delivering our new native mobile applications for the Summer was in trouble.

The architectural design was sound, but the time and available resource was not. The problem was not universal, as Infrastructure 2 and the build out of the native applications was proceeding to plan. However, the team building the Public API interface and supporting micro-services had a couple of [sprints](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Sprint) behind them and had established a velocity. At this point the entire backlog of work was estimated and the sad news was that we would miss the delivery date. Not just by a couple of weeks, but by a whole year.

One of the hardest things a person has to deal with is realizing their dream is unattainable, at least given the timetables being discussed. I had to admit to myself the project was not going to deliver in time. I was either going to have to compromise on the delivery goals in order to match scope to available resource and time; or put my head in the sand and push forward in full knowledge it was an impossible deadline.

After reviewing the hard facts, together with the project and development team we devised a revised scope that fit into the timeline. It would leave little room for error, but would be delivered in the Summer as planned. By the end of March we all were working hard once more to meet the objectives for the company.

It was around now that I discovered that one of my proposed talks had been selected for the [Dutch Mobile Conference 2014](/blog/2014/04/05/dutch-mobile-conference-2014/) in Amsterdam. Accepting the offer speak in Amsterdam meant that I would loose the next two months of my life writing the talk. The subject matter was dear to my heart and generally not discussed in the mobile development circuit at the time.

I did not realize quite how big a time sink writing the talk would be this time around. It was hardly the first talk I have written and presented. What did differ and made the biggest impact was that I wanted to provide live demos during the presentation. For anyone out there thinking of submitting an abstract to a conference, listen closely! Live demonstrations require at least two-hundred percent more effort to prepare and practice when compared with a talk without demonstrations. However, talks with live demonstrations can be at least two-hundred percent more engaging than talks without, depending on the subject.
